The **CPUE dataset** is derived by combining catch (Level 0 or 2) with effort (Level 0) on common strata.

**Formula:**
```r
CPUE = Catch / Effort 
```

for each strata of the two datasets. 

It is to be noted that the some stratas are present in only one of the datasets, meaning they are incomplete as efforts could be without catches but catches displayed without efforts point out issues in one of the two datasets.

- The unit depends on the effort measure (e.g., mt / 1000 hooks).
- Multiple CPUE datasets can be created depending on the catch dataset that is used in the formula.
- Scripts in [CPUE script](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas/blob/9a58ec9394d79a937d903cd544443224d4478f89/launching_jsons_creating_GTA.R#L410) handle joining, raising, and outputting CPUE tables.
- Outputs are saved in standardized CWP formats, ready for visualization or publication.
