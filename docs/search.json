    "text": "This short notebook will guide you through the key features and technical setup of the RStudio Server in VLab5.\n\n\nTo begin working in VLab5 with R workflows, start by navigating to the Analytics section on the platform.\nYou have two main options to launch an RStudio session:\n\nRStudio on D4Science (Start) ‚Äì This is the default environment. It includes all preloaded repositories you‚Äôll use in this course (both stable and dev versions). It has limited RAM compared to the second option.\nRStudio on GoogleCloud (Start) ‚Äì This environment offers more RAM and computing power, which can be useful for heavier computations. However, it does not include the preloaded repositories by default. If you use it, you‚Äôll need to manually configure and copy the necessary projects.\n\nOnce you launch either version, you‚Äôll enter a standard RStudio Server interface directly in your browser.\nRStudio is organized into four panes:\n\nTop-left: Script editor\nBottom-left: Console and Terminal\n\nThe Console is where you type and run R code interactively.\nThe Terminal provides access to a Unix shell, useful for running system commands (e.g., Git, file management).\nThe Background Jobs tab (when visible) lets you launch long-running scripts without blocking the console. You can track progress and logs independently.\n\n\n\nüß© These tabs are modular: you can show or hide panes using the menu bar ‚Üí View > Panes or via the small gear icons in the top-right of each panel.\n\n\nTop-right: Environment, History, Git, Connections, Build, Tutorial\n\nThe Environment tab lists all current objects (datasets, models, functions).\nHistory tracks all commands you‚Äôve run.\nGit appears if the project is under version control.\nBuild is used for R packages or Quarto/Bookdown projects.\nTutorial can show RStudio tutorials if available.\n\nBottom-right: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer\n\nThis pane lets you navigate directories, visualize plots, install/view packages, access help pages, and render HTML outputs.\n\n\nTo explore the technical setup of your session, run the following lines of code in the R console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR.version.string\n\n[1] \"R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrstudioapi::versionInfo()\n\nThis returns information such as: - version: RStudio version installed (e.g., 2023.3.0.386) - release_name: Code name for the release (e.g., Cherry Blossom) - mode: Whether you‚Äôre on the server version\n\n\n\n\nSys.info()\n\n                                                          sysname \n                                                          \"Linux\" \n                                                          release \n                                             \"4.15.0-189-generic\" \n                                                          version \n                   \"#200-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 22 19:53:37 UTC 2022\" \n                                                         nodename \n\"jupyter-bastien-2egrasset65011--rname-2d-52-53tudio-53erver-4fp\" \n                                                          machine \n                                                         \"x86_64\" \n                                                            login \n                                                        \"unknown\" \n                                                             user \n                                                         \"jovyan\" \n                                                   effective_user \n                                                         \"jovyan\" \n\n\nYou‚Äôll see OS-level details such as: - sysname: Operating system - release: Kernel version - machine: Architecture (usually x86_64) - user: Your current user session (likely jovyan)\n\n\n\n# Note: this uses system-level shell command\nsystem(\"free -g\")\nThis command shows approximate memory allocation: - total: Total memory available (e.g., 125 GB) - used and available: What‚Äôs currently in use or free\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The number you see in ‚Äúavailable‚Äù RAM may be lower (e.g., 32 GB) due to container quotas or dynamic allocation.
