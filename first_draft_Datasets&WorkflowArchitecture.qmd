# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Distinguish nominal, geo-referenced, effort, and CPUE datasets.
- Understand the GTA workflow architecture and reproducibility principles.
- Recognize specificities and caveats for each dataset (e.g., raising rules, effort unit heterogeneity).
- Locate the code and repositories to reproduce or customize GTA datasets.

# Overview of the Global Tuna Atlas datasets and workflow architecture

The **Global Tuna Atlas (GTA)** integrates catch and effort data from all five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (t-RFMOs). The GTA workflows are designed to make tuna fisheries data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and reproducible.

The workflow architecture includes:

- **Nominal catches** (annual, aggregated by fleet, gear, species, large area).
- **Geo-referenced catches** (monthly, fine spatial resolution: 1Â° or 5Â°).
- **Effort datasets** (various measurement units, unaggregated to preserve semantics).
- **Derived CPUE datasets** (catch-per-unit-effort).

Each dataset is produced using harmonized formats based on [CWP standards](https://www.fao.org/3/cc6734en/cc6734en.pdf) and reproducible scripts available in the [geoflow-tunaatlas repository for level 2 and efforts (IRD)](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas) and [geoflow-tunaatlas repository for level 0 (FIRMS)](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-gta).

# Presentation of dataset specificities

## Nominal Catch Dataset (FIRMS Level 0)
- **Time span:** 1918â€“2023.
- **Content:** Live-weight equivalent (metric tonnes), mainly retained catches.
- **Stratification:** Year, fleet, gear, large area, species.
- **Use case:** Benchmark of global tuna catch volumes.
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.5745958](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5745958).

## Geo-referenced Catch Datasets

### FIRMS Level 0
- **Time span:** 1950â€“2023.
- **Resolution:** 1Â°/5Â° grid, monthly.
- **Content:** Catches from all t-RFMOs, harmonized.
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.5747174](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5747174).

### IRD Level 2
- Further processed to align geo-referenced data with nominal totals.
- Includes raising, updating of strata, and better handling of IATTC observer vs logbook data.
- **Warning:** Not suitable for quota/legality studies due to uncertainty in precise georeferencing.
- **Code:** Full workflow at [geoflow-tunaatlas](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas).
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15496164](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.15496164).

## Effort Dataset (IRD Level 0)
- **Time span:** 1950â€“2023.
- **Content:** 23 different measurement units, no aggregation.
- **Specificities:** Duplicates exist (e.g., ICCAT Hours.FAD vs Hours.FSC; WCPFC SETS vs DAYS). End-users must harmonize depending on research needs.
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15496164](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.15496164).

# CPUE code and derivation

The **CPUE dataset** is derived by combining catch (Level 0 or 2) with effort (Level 0) on common strata.

**Formula:**
```r
CPUE = Catch / Effort 
```

for each strata of datasets. It is to be noted that the some stratas are present in only one of the datasets, meaning they are incomplete as efforts could be without catches but catches should'nt be displayed without efforts.

- The unit depends on the effort measure (e.g., mt / 1000 hooks).
- Scripts in [geoflow-tunaatlas](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas) handle joining, raising, and outputting CPUE tables.
- Outputs are saved in standardized CWP formats, ready for visualization or publication.

If you want to explore some of the CWP datasets, some .Rmd are available in the repos as well as shiny apps (later in the courses)
