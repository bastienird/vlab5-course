# Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

- Explain why **reproducibility** is a key principle in scientific data workflows.  
- Understand the role of **DOIs** and the **FAIR principles**.  
- Recognize how reproducibility is implemented in the Global Tuna Atlas (GTA) workflows.  
- Identify what parts of the workflow are *not* reproducible, and why.

# 1. Why reproducibility matters

Scientific analyses must be **transparent, traceable, and repeatable**.  

In fisheries data, reproducibility ensures that:

- Other researchers can validate results.  
- Policy-makers can rely on **evidence-based advice**.  
- Updates to datasets can be compared to earlier versions.  

The **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provide a framework to guarantee these goals.  

**DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)** are used in GTA to make datasets **citable and permanent**.

# 2. How reproducibility is implemented in GTA workflows

## RStudio Server in VLab5

Provides the *same environment* (same RStudio version and resources) for all learners and users.  

## `renv` package
Manages R dependencies by locking package versions in `renv.lock`, ensuring analyses run identically across sessions.  

```r
# Restore all packages for a project
renv::restore()
```

## Docker images

Provide portable containers that encapsulate code, packages, and system dependencies.  
This ensures the same workflow runs identically on any machine.

# 3. What is *not* reproducible

- The **direct database connection** cannot be fully shared:
  - Requires **passwords** that cannot be distributed publicly.  
  - Risk of overload if too many users connect simultaneously.  

Instead, reproducibility is achieved by providing:

- **Exported datasets** (via Zenodo DOIs).  
- **Scripts** that rebuild processing steps.  

Each user could, if needed, set up their *own database instance* locally.
