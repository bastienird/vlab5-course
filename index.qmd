## Welcome

This website brings together tutorials and courses on the **Global Tuna Atlas (GTA)** datasets, the related **Shiny applications**, and how to use **VLab5** within the **Blue-Cloud 2026** project.  
Our aim is to help researchers, practitioners and decision-makers explore, analyse and **reproduce** global tuna fisheries workflows.

**You will learn to:**

- understand the structure and provenance of GTA datasets;
- run analyses reproducibly on VLab5;
- use GTA Shiny apps for exploration and QA/QC.


> **Acknowledgement.** This work is part of **Blue-Cloud 2026** and has received funding from the **European Union’s Horizon Europe** programme (Grant Agreement **No 101094227**).

## Modules

#### Lesson 1 - Intro to Global Tuna Atlas

This lesson introduces the **Global Tuna Atlas (GTA)**: its purpose, data levels (nominal, georeferenced, raised), and how it brings together datasets from all tuna RFMOs for global transparency and comparability.

---

#### Lesson 2 - Running R Workflows in VLab5

Here you will learn how to run **reproducible R workflows** inside **VLab5**, using tools like `renv`, and understand how GTA workflows ensure consistency and collaboration.

---

#### Lesson 3 - Exploring GTA Data via Shiny

This lesson shows how to explore GTA datasets with **Shiny apps**: filtering by species, fleet, or gear, visualizing catches and effort through maps and time series, and exporting results easily.
