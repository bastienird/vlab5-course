<!-- ## Objectives -->

<!-- By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to: -->

<!-- - Describe what the **CWP (Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics)** is. -->
<!-- - Understand its role in establishing **global statistical standards** for fisheries data. -->
<!-- - Recognize how GTA aligns with CWP standards for harmonization and interoperability. -->

## 1. Introduction to the CWP

The **Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP)**, under FAO’s leadership, is the main international forum for agreeing on:

- **Common definitions, classifications, and standards** for capturing fishery and aquaculture statistics.
- It develops methods, reduces workload for national statistical offices, and promotes harmonization across regions.  https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/a7f3993f-1af1-4e65-8b91-036d12a34458/content

## 2. What CWP offers — Handbook & best practices

The **CWP Handbook of Fishery Statistics** provides:

- Standard terminology for **catch**, **fishing effort**, and **aquaculture** data.
- Classifications like the **ASFIS list** (species codes), and structured data exchange protocols.  

It also shares best practices in:

- Harmonization, geospatial standards, managing sensitive/confidential data, and workflows.

## 3. Alignment with GTA workflows

The GTA builds on CWP foundations by:

- Applying **harmonized vocabularies** and species coding systems in **Level 0 datasets**.
- Structuring processed outputs (Level 2) using standardized classifications for interoperability.

This ensures that GTA outputs are **FAIR-aligned** and can integrate seamlessly with global fisheries systems.
