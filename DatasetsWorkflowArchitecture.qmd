<!-- # Objectives  -->

<!-- By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: -->

<!-- - Distinguish nominal, geo-referenced, effort, and CPUE datasets. -->
<!-- - Understand the GTA workflow architecture and reproducibility principles. -->
<!-- - Recognize specificities and caveats for each dataset (e.g., raising rules, effort unit heterogeneity). -->
<!-- - Locate the code and repositories to reproduce or customize GTA datasets. -->

# Overview of the Global Tuna Atlas datasets and workflow architecture

The **Global Tuna Atlas (GTA)** integrates catch and effort data from all five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (t-RFMOs). The GTA workflows are designed to make tuna fisheries data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and reproducible.

The workflow architecture includes:

- **Nominal catches** (annual, aggregated by fleet, gear, species, large area).
- **Geo-referenced catches** (monthly, fine spatial resolution: 1° or 5°).
- **Effort datasets** (various measurement units, unaggregated to preserve semantics).
- **Derived CPUE datasets** (catch-per-unit-effort).

Each dataset is produced using harmonized formats based on [CWP standards](https://www.fao.org/3/cc6734en/cc6734en.pdf) and reproducible scripts available in the [geoflow-tunaatlas repository for level 2 and efforts (IRD)](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas) and [geoflow-tunaatlas repository for level 0 (FIRMS)](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-gta).

# Presentation of dataset specificities

## Nominal Catch Dataset (FIRMS Level 0)
- **Time span:** 1918–2023.
- **Content:** Live-weight equivalent (metric tonnes), mainly retained catches.
- **Stratification:** Year, fleet, gear, large area, species.
- **Use case:** Benchmark of global tuna catch volumes.
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.5745958](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5745958).

## Geo-referenced Catch Datasets

### FIRMS Level 0
- **Time span:** 1950–2023.
- **Resolution:** 1°/5° grid, monthly.
- **Content:** Catches from all t-RFMOs, harmonized.
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.5747174](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5747174).

### IRD Level 2
- Further processed to align geo-referenced data with nominal totals.
- Includes raising, updating of strata, and better handling of IATTC observer vs logbook data.
- **Warning:** Not suitable for quota/legality studies due to uncertainty in precise georeferencing.
- **Code:** Full workflow at [geoflow-tunaatlas](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas).
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15496164](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.15496164).

## Effort Dataset (IRD Level 0)
- **Time span:** 1950–2023.
- **Content:** 23 different measurement units, no aggregation.
- **Specificities:** Duplicates exist (e.g., ICCAT Hours.FAD vs Hours.FSC; WCPFC SETS vs DAYS). End-users must harmonize depending on research needs.
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15496164](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.15496164).
